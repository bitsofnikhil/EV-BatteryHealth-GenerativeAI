# Week 1 – Research Summary

## Problem Statement
Predicting the health and remaining life of EV batteries is a key challenge due to limited real-world data.

## Research Summary
- Studied open datasets and research papers on EV battery performance.  
- Explored Generative AI models like GANs and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for synthetic data generation.  
- Planned data preprocessing and simulation steps.  

## Next Week Plan
- Implement data generation pipeline.
- Start preparing a small synthetic dataset using Python.
