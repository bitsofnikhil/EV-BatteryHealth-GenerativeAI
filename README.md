# ⚡ Generative AI for Battery Health Prediction in Electric Vehicles

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores how Generative AI can be used to predict and improve the health and lifespan of electric vehicle (EV) batteries.  
Due to limited real-world datasets, models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or GANs will be used to generate synthetic battery-usage data to train predictive models effectively.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand EV battery degradation factors.
- Generate synthetic battery datasets using Generative AI.
- Train models to predict remaining battery health and lifespan.
- Compare model performance with and without generated data.

## 🗓 Week 1 Progress
- Researched EV battery degradation and performance indicators.
- Studied how Generative AI can create synthetic datasets.
- Created GitHub repository and initial project documentation.

## ⚙ Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## 📅 Next Steps
- Collect or create a small EV battery dataset.  
- Build a simple Generative AI model (VAE/GAN) for data generation.  
- Train predictive model and evaluate performance.
